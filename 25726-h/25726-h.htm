    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It had taken him a long time, and it had cost him&mdash;José&mdash;much
      hard labor, to prepare for his aged grandmother and Pepita the tiny home
      outside Madrid, to which he at last brought them in great triumph one hot
      summer's day, when the very vine-leaves and orange-trees themselves were
      dusty. It had been a great undertaking for him in the first place, for he
      was a slow fellow&mdash;José; slow as he was dull and kind and faithful to
      Pepita and the grandmother. He had a body as big as an ox, and a heart as
      big as his body, but he was slow and dull in everything but one thing&mdash;that
      was his carpenter work. He was well enough at that, and more than well
      enough, for he had always had a fancy and a knack for it from the time
      when as a boy he had worked in his uncle's vineyards and tilled his fields
      and fed his beasts. His uncle had been counted a rich man among his
      neighbors, but when his sister and her husband died and left the two
      children, José and Pepita, penniless, and with no protector save himself
      and their grandmother, already an old woman, it was upon the grandmother
      that the burden fell, for he did nothing for them except to give them,
      grudgingly now and then, a few poor vegetables or a little fallen fruit.
      It is true that when José was old enough to labor in the fields he gave
      him work to do, but he paid him ill and treated him ill also, giving him
      poor food and harsh words, and often enough blows the poor lad did not
      deserve. So it came about that while he was at his work José fell into the
      way of planning to escape from all this, and make another home for himself
      and his pretty child-sister and the old woman. He knew there was only one
      way to do it: if he could carry his one gift where it would be of more use
      to him than it could possibly be in a poor small village; if he could
      carry it to a market where there were more people and where work was
      better paid for. Where the king and queen were, of course, there must be
      more money, and one could find more to do and live better. It was Padre
      Alejandro, the village priest, who had suggested this to him first. He was
      a kind, jovial old fellow, the padre, and had seen something of the world,
      too, long ago, which was perhaps why he was never very hard upon a simple
      sinner who went to confession, and could give a bit of unecclesiastical
      advice now and then. He had always been kind to José, and as Pepita had
      grown prettier and prettier every day, he had often spoken of her to old
      Jovita, and said she should be well taught and taken care of, and once
      even&mdash;when she had come into the house with a basket of grapes on her
      little head, rose-flushed with the hot day, her black hair curling in
      moist silken rings on her forehead&mdash;he had been betrayed into the
      worldly remark that such pretty young things ought to have something
      brighter to look forward to than hard work and scant fare, which made them
      old before their time, and left them nothing to look back upon. But he
      only said it to Jovita, and Jovita only stared a little, it never having
      occurred to her that there was anything much in the world but hard labor
      and poverty. And what difference did it make that one was pretty, except
      that it became more probable that some gay, lazy fellow would pretend to
      fall in love with one, and then after marriage leave one all the work to
      do and a houseful of hungry children to feed? She had seen that often
      enough. Had it not been so with Pepita's mother, who died at twenty-five
      almost an old woman, worn out with trouble and hard usage?
    </p>
    <p>
      But afterward, when Padre Alejandro saw José, he spoke of Pepita to him
      also, though only as if incidentally among other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She should marry some good fellow who could take care of her," he said.
      "If you go to Madrid it will also be better for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the end of it all was that after much slow planning and many hopes
      and fears, and more than one disappointment, there came a day when the
      uncle was thrown into a violent rage by losing his best and most patient
      worker, and the poor cottage stood empty, and José and Pepita and Jovita
      found themselves in a new world.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a new world it seemed to them all! Through the help of Padre
      Alejandro and an old friend of his, José had work bringing him pay which
      appeared absolute wealth to him. The cottage, with its good walls and
      roof, its neat rooms and garden, being compared with the mere hut they had
      left behind, seemed a palace. For the first few days, indeed, Jovita was
      scarce at ease; to feel no necessity for heavy labor, to have food enough,
      to be so comfortable, seemed unnatural, as if it might finally bring
      disaster. But it was not so with Pepita. All the joy of youth, all its
      delights and expectations filled her heart. To be so near the great, grand
      city, to look forward to seeing all its splendors, to walk in its streets,
      to share in the amusements she had heard of&mdash;this was rapture. If she
      had been pretty before, she became now ten times prettier; her lovely eyes
      grew larger with laughter and wonder and joy; her light feet almost
      danced; her color was like that of a damask rose. Each day brought new
      innocent happiness to her. When José came home from his work at night, she
      sat by his side and asked him a thousand questions. Had he seen the palace&mdash;had
      he seen the king or the queen&mdash;what were the people doing&mdash;were
      the public gardens beautiful?
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0001" id="linkimage-0001">

    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/010.jpg" alt="And then She Would Take the Guitar 010 "
      width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      And then she would take the guitar, which had belonged to her gay father
      in his gayest days, and sit out in the little garden, among the vines and
      lemon-trees and oleanders, and play and sing one song after another, while
      José smoked and rested, and wondered at and delighted in her. It was she
      who had inherited all her father's gayety and spirit. José had none of
      them, and, being slow and simple, had always found her a wonder and a
      strange pleasure. She had, indeed, been the one bright thing in his life,
      and even her wilfulness had a charm for him. He always gave way to it and
      was content. Had she not even once defied the uncle when no one else would
      have dared to do it? holding her little head up and confronting him in
      such a burst of pretty rage that the old curmudgeon had been quite quelled
      for once in his life, and had ever afterward treated her with a kind of
      respect, even saying to a neighbor that "the lad was a fool, but the
      little devil had something in her, after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      In all his plannings it was Pepita José had thought of first. Madrid to
      him was only a sort of setting for Pepita; the clean, comfortable cottage
      a home for Pepita; the roses and lemon blossoms she would wear in her
      hair; under the fine grape-vines she would sit in the evening and play on
      her guitar. His wages would give her comfort and buy her pretty simple
      dresses. And then every one would see her beauty, and when she went to
      mass, or with himself and Jovita to the Prado or the Paseo de la Virgen
      del Puerto, people would look at her and tell each other how pretty she
      was, and all this would end in time in a good marriage perhaps. And she
      would be loved by some nice fellow, and have a home of her own, and be as
      happy as the day was long. There was only one obstacle in the way of this
      excellent plan; it was only a small obstacle, but&mdash;it was Pepita
      herself! Singularly enough, Pepita had a fixed antipathy to marriage. She
      had early announced her intention of remaining unmarried, and those young
      men who in her native village had desired to make love to her had been
      treated with disapproval and disdain. Knowing as little of love as a young
      bird unfledged, her coldness was full of innocent cruelty. She made no
      effort to soften any situation. She was willing to dance and laugh and
      sing, but when she found herself confronting lover-like tremors and
      emotion, she was unsparing candor itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I listen to you?" she had said more than once. "I do not love
      you. You do not please me. When you wish to marry me, I hate you. Go away,
      and speak to some one else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will never marry any one," she said to José. "I will stay with you and
      be happy. Girls who marry grow ugly and are wretched. Their husbands do
      not love them after they are married. They must work and slave and take
      care of the house and the children. Look at Tessa! Her husband used to be
      wild about her. She could make him pale with misery if she turned away
      from him; he used to follow her about everywhere. Now he makes eyes at
      Juanita, and beats Tessa if she complains. And don't we both remember how
      it was with our mother? I will never love any one, and never be married.
      Let them love me if they are so stupid, but I will be left alone. I care
      nothing for any of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is that José knew it was what she remembered of her mother's
      unhappiness and what Jovita had told her, which was the foundation of all
      this. Did he not remember it himself, and remember, with a shudder, those
      first miserable years of their childhood&mdash;the great, beautiful,
      wretched eyes of their mother, their gay, handsome father, and his
      careless cruelty and frequent brutality? Had not Pepita and himself clung
      together hidden in the loft at night, listening to their mother's sobs,
      and often to the sound of blows and curses rained down upon her because
      she was no longer a beauty, and there were beauties who had smiles to
      bestow on handsome fellows who were free, and even upon those who were
      not? It was enough to irritate any handsome fellow&mdash;this one had
      thought&mdash;to come home to a squalid place after enjoyment, and be
      forced to face poverty and children and a haggard wife with large staring
      eyes, red with weeping. Yes, Pepita and José remembered all this, and upon
      Pepita's character it had left curious traces. Young as she was, she had
      awakened quite grand passions in more than one heart, and on two or three
      occasions the suitors had been of far better fortune than herself&mdash;one
      of them, indeed, being the only son of a rich farmer, who might have
      chosen a wife of much greater importance than this pretty, scornful child,
      and whose family rebelled bitterly against his folly, and at last sent him
      away to Seville, but not before Pepita herself had coolly trodden him
      under her small feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like you less than any of them," she said, fixing her great, direct
      eyes upon him when he revealed his frenzy. "Go and marry that girl your
      father chose for you&mdash;if she will have you. They have no need to be
      afraid and speak ill of me. I don't want you. I can't bear to have you
      stand near me."
    </p>
    <p>
      To José it never occurred to complain of her, but Jovita's sense of
      worldly advantage was outraged at this time, and she did not hesitate to
      express herself with much freedom and grumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows, I want no haste," she said; "but this is a chance for any
      girl. And see what a fool she is. But that is as it always happens. There
      will come along some worthless fellow, and she will be fooled like the
      rest, and be ready enough to run after him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!" said Pepita, who stood in the doorway. "I!" And she opened her dark
      eyes in genuine anger and amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you," answered Jovita. "And you will be worse than any of them.
      Girls who think themselves too good to be spoken to are always easiest to
      coax when they find their match. Let him come, and you'll drop like a ripe
      grape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will never come," said Pepita. "Never!" And there was not a shade of
      doubt in her look&mdash;nothing but cold indignation at Jovita's
      ill-humor. "I am not afraid of men. They are all stupid. They think they
      can have anything they want, and they can have nothing. They have to ask,
      and it is the girls who can say 'No;' and then they are miserable, and beg
      and beg until one detests them. If any one said 'No' to me, I would not
      let them see it hurt me. They should think I did not care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not always say 'No,'" grumbled Jovita. "Wait till the day for
      'Yes' comes. You'll say it fast enough. That's the way with women."
    </p>
    <p>
      A bewitching little smile slowly curved Pepita's lips and crept into her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not a woman," she said, looking out at the sun-warmed vineyards. "He
      said so himself. Felipe said, 'You are not a woman; you are a witch, and
      no one can touch your heart or conquer you.' I will be a witch."
    </p>
    <p>
      Secretly she had liked those words better than any of the adoring praises
      she had heard before. She liked the suggestion that she was invincible and
      safe from all danger&mdash;to be a witch&mdash;to be free from all this
      disastrous folly&mdash;to be unconquerable. Yes, that pleased her. It was
      not her fault that they would fall in love with her. What did she do to
      them? Nothing. She never allowed them to come near her or touch her; she
      never gave them tender glances or words. She laughed and was Pepita&mdash;that
      was all. Then it was no fault of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet her little heart was warm enough. She loved José passionately; she
      loved Jo-vita; she loved little children and animals, and they loved her
      in return; old men and women adored her because of her simple, almost
      childish kindness and her readiness to help those who needed her young
      strength and bright spirit. It was only men who made love who were shown
      no mercy. She did not know that they needed mercy. She did not understand&mdash;that
      was all. It was as José had known it would be. When on the first holiday
      be took her to the public gardens with Jovita, every one who passed them
      gave her a second look; many turned to watch her; certainly there was not
      a man who did not glance over his shoulder at the bewitching girlish
      figure with the small round waist, at the piquant radiant face, at the
      well-carried little head with the red rose blooming in its cloud of soft
      black hair.

    <p>
      It was not long before two or three who were José's fellow-workmen sought
      him out and greeted him with great warmth. They had, it appeared, a great
      deal to say and many attentions to lavish upon him. Such a fine fellow,
      this José&mdash;such a good fellow&mdash;such a workman as was seldom seen
      in Madrid. And what a fine day for pleasure. And the Paseo de la Virgen
      del Puerto&mdash;there never were such gardens for sport. And all the time
      each one looked at Pepita, and lucky indeed was the man with mother and
      sisters to help him to make friends. And never had old Jovita met with
      such civilities, and encountered such deference. Pepita had the joy of a
      young bird in its first flight. The air of gayety enlivening everything,
      the people in their holiday clothes, the blue sky, the sunshine, the cheap
      simple pleasures of the day, were intoxicating delights to her. She made
      friends with the girls and their parents, and was even gracious to the
      young men who hung about José, and somehow seemed to find his neighborhood
      more attractive than any other. It was from one of these young men (his
      name was Manuel) she first heard of Sebastiano&mdash;the gay, the
      wonderful, the renowned Sebastiano. He had asked her, this Manuel, if she
      was going to the Plaza de Toros to see the bull-fight the following week,
      and when she said she did not know&mdash;that she had never seen a
      bull-fight&mdash;he found a great deal to say. He described the wonders of
      the great bull ring, where twelve thousand people could be accommodated,
      and where grand and beautiful ladies richly dressed and surrounded by
      their lovers and husbands uttered cries of joy and excitement as the fight
      became more dangerous, and both bulls and toreadors showed greater courage
      and fire; he described the costumes, the music, the picadors dashing in
      upon their horses; the banderilleros with their darts and ribbons; the
      matador with his reckless daring, his nerves and muscles of steel, and his
      lightning leaps. And then he described Sebastiano. Never before, it
      appeared from his enthusiasm, had Madrid known such a matador as
      Sebastiano. Never one so handsome, so dashing, so universally adored. When
      he appeared in the ring, what a roar of applause went up. When he made his
      proud bow to the president, and said, "I go to slay this bull for the
      honor of the people of Madrid and the most excellent president of this
      tourney," and threw his hat away and moved forward, waving his scarlet
      cloak, what excitement there was awakened. Songs were sung about him in
      the streets, fans were ornamented with pictures of his daring deeds, there
      were stories of great ladies who had wept their eyes out for love of him,
      and as to the women of his own class, there was not a girl in Madrid who
      did not dream of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" said Pepita, in her cold, soft voice, and with the simply cold and
      curious look in her great, richly lashed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because they are in love with him&mdash;all of them," replied Manuel,
      sweepingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" said Pepita, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "' Why?'" Manuel echoed, somewhat bewildered by the frank, indifferent
      ignoring of all natural reasons in this question&mdash;"'why?' Because he
      is so tall and strong and well made, because he is handsome, because he is
      more daring and graceful than any of the others&mdash;because he is
      Sebastiano."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita laughed, and opened and shut her fan quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you laugh?" inquired Manuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking how he must despise them," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," said Manuel, who was not very clever; "he is always good to
      women. There was Sarita&mdash;a poor little thing who had always lived in
      the country. She saw him at her first bull-fight and was never happy
      afterward. She could think of nothing else, and she was too innocent to
      hide it. She used to slip away from home and contrive to follow him when
      he did not see her. She found a woman who knew some one who knew him, and
      she gave her all her little savings in presents to bribe her to be her
      friend and talk to her about him. Once or twice she met him, and because
      she was such a pretty little one, he spoke kindly to her and praised her
      eyes and her dancing. He did not know she was in love with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you do that?" Manuel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He knew," said Pepita. "He would <i>think</i> she was, even if she cared
      nothing for him, and since she did care he would know before she did and
      would be proud of it, and make it as much worse as he could."
    </p>
    <p>
      Manuel gazed at her a moment in silence, twirling his rather small
      mustacha. This beautiful, cool, mocking little person, the melting
      softness of whose eyes and lips should have promised such feminine
      tenderness and emotion, bewildered him greatly; it was plain that she was
      wholly unmoved by the glories of Sebastiano, and saw no glamour in his
      romances. What other girl would have asked "Why?"&mdash;and in that tone?
      It was difficult to go on with his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He could not help it that she was in love with him," he said. "And she
      could not help it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" inquired Pepita for the third time, and with a prettier coolness
      than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," stammered Manuel, "because&mdash;because that is the way with all
      of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita showed all her little gleaming teeth, and then put the stem of a
      rose between them and held it there like a cigarette as she looked under
      her eyelashes at the people. The rose was not as red as her scornful
      little mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was always kind to her when he saw her," continued Manuel. "Once he
      gave her his <i>devisa</i>. When she died she held it in her hand and
      would not let it go. It was buried with her. She was a pretty child&mdash;Sarita&mdash;but
      she had always lived in the country and knew nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have always lived in the country and I know nothing," said Pepita,
      mocking him with her great eyes; "but <i>I</i> can help anything I choose.
      It should be the others who cannot help it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought him dull and tiresome, and soon wished he would go away, but
      he could not help it, and lingered about with all sorts of stupid excuses.
      The more she bewildered him, the more he was fascinated. It was almost
      enough to stand and stare at her and hear her voice as she talked to the
      others. How pretty she was&mdash;that girl&mdash;how she held her head as
      if she was some high-born lady instead of a peasant! When some passer-by,
      more bold than the rest, made (loud enough to be heard) some comment upon
      her beauty, it did not disturb her in the least&mdash;it was as if it were
      nothing to her. Was it possible that there could live a girl who did not
      care that she was so pretty? But to imagine that she did not care was to
      make a great mistake&mdash;she cared very much. Ever since she had been a
      tiny child, her little mirror and the water of the fountain had reflected
      back to her this pretty face, with its soft rose of cheek and mouth, its
      dark liquid eyes, and soft babyish rings of hair curling on the forehead.
      She had always heard too that she was pretty, and as she had grown older
      she had found out something else, namely, that she had a power more strong
      and subtle than that of her beauty&mdash;a power people did not even try
      to resist. She did not call it by any name herself or understand it in the
      least. She often wondered at it, and even sometimes had a childish secret
      terror lest the Evil One might have something to do with it; particularly
      when without making any effort, when simply standing apart and looking on
      at the rest, with a little smile she had drawn to her side the stupid
      love-making for which she cared nothing. It was not so with Dolores and
      Maria and Isabella, who were pretty too. Somehow, handsome as they were,
      they must use their eyes on their lovers, they must laugh and dance and
      talk to be adored, while she need do nothing but be Pepita.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, late that evening, she sat with José under the vines, the air about
      them heavy with jasmine and orange and lemon blossoms, she asked a great
      many questions about the bull-fight. It must be a grand thing to see&mdash;so
      many people, such gay colors, such music. José could describe it better
      than Manuel. He must tell her all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He described it as well as he could, and in spite of his slow speech made
      quite an exciting picture for her; or rather she found it exciting, as she
      found all things just now in their novelty. Before Jovita and she had
      arrived, while he was making his small preparations for them, he had seen
      a bull-fight or so, and no point of detail had escaped his deliberate
      mind. He always remembered things&mdash;José.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you shall go," he said; "you shall go and see for yourself the very
      next time. It comes next week. We will go and take Jovita."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita clapped her hands for joy. She sprang up and danced a few steps in
      her childish delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be happiness," she said. "What happiness! Perhaps the king and
      queen will be there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see Sebastiano," said José, seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not care for Sebastiano," cried Pepita, petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not care," said José, in blank amaze, "for Sebastiano? You do not
      care?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They talk too much of him," she answered, "and he is too vain. He thinks
      all women are in love with him, and that if a girl comes from the country
      she knows nothing, and will die of love if she only sees him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not know that," said José, staring. "I never heard them say so.
      They call him a fine fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard them say so," Pepita answered scornfully; "but I know it. I
      am sure he is a fool," which remark caused José much bewilderment, and led
      him to reflect long and deeply, but did not, however, lead him to any
      conclusion but that Pepita was ruled by one of her caprices. He was rather
      afraid to admit that he himself had enjoyed the magnificent honor of
      seeing this great hero out of the ring; that through a quite miraculous
      favor he had even been allowed to speak to him and to hear him speak as he
      stood, the centre of a circle of admirers in a wine-shop. He had been
      saving this to tell Pepita, but now he thought it well to save it a little
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the day of the bull-fight arrived it was not possible to conceal
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! the wonders, the splendors of that day from the first hour! At its
      very dawning Pepita was up and singing. Jovita must take her rest, that
      she might be in her best humor to enjoy the festivities, and not spoil
      them by grumbling. Pepita needed no rest; her little feet danced as she
      moved; as she made her preparations for the morning meal she chatted
      incessantly to José, asking a thousand questions. Everything conspired to
      add to her joys. The sky was deep brilliant blue, but there was a light
      breeze to make the heat bearable; the birds sang until their little
      throats throbbed; the flowers in the garden seemed to have flung out new
      masses of bloom to make the small world about them brighter. In her
      chamber, near the roof, Pepita's gala dress lay upon her bed, her new
      little shoes upon the floor; she had seen them in the moonlight each time
      she had awakened in the night. A year ago it would not have seemed
      possible that such pretty finery could ever be hers, even in dreams; but
      now almost anything seemed possible in this new and enchanting life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she was dressed how bewitching she was! how her rose of a face
      glowed and dimpled! how enchanting was the velvet darkness of her eyes!
      how airy the poise of her little black head, with its brilliant flower
      tucked in at the side of the knot of curly hair! Jovita stared at her and
      made a queer half-internal sound of exclamation. It was not her way to
      express approval at all freely, and she had no opinion of people who
      wasted time in telling girls they were pretty. But José looked at the girl
      as he might have looked at some rare tropical bird which had suddenly
      flown into the house. He looked and looked again, pulling his mustache,
      his not always alert face warming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," he said, "it all looks very well; that dress is pretty. None
      of the other girls will look better. Even Candida&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita laughed. Candida had been considered a great beauty in the village
      they had left, but she knew she was prettier than Candida.
    </p>
    <p>
      José laughed also, though he scarcely knew why. Then with rather a
      cautious and uncertain air he produced a gay fan&mdash;a cheap one, but
      brilliant with color.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This&mdash;" he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita caught it from him, and unfurled it with a quick turn of her wrist.
      On one side was a picture&mdash;a dashing erect figure, in a richly hued
      costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Sebastiano," said José, guiltily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita nodded her head and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew it," she said; "I knew he would look like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no other man who can slay a bull as he can," said José.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him slay them," answered Pepita. And she stood and waved her fan with
      the prettiest inscrutable air in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey to the Plaza de Toros was almost as delightful as the
      bull-fight itself to Pepita. The streaming crowds of people, all bent in
      one direction, and all in their gayest dress and mood, laughing, jostling
      each other, chatting, exchanging salutations and jokes, the grand
      carriages rolling by with fine ladies and gentlemen in them, the rattling
      old diligences, omnibuses, and <i>tartanes</i>, whose passengers seemed
      more hilarious than the occupants of the more splendid equipages, the
      ringing of mule bells, the shouts of drivers, the cracking whips, the
      sunshine, the color, the very dust itself, all added to the excitement of
      the hour. And as they made their way through the throng, it was again as
      it had been that first Sunday at the Paseo de la Virgen del Puerto, heads
      turned and exclamations were uttered when Pepita went by. And somehow it
      seemed that José was better known than even he himself had imagined, he
      received so many greetings. The truth was that already those who had seen
      the girl had spoken of her among themselves and to others, their readily
      fired Spanish natures aflame and elate. And those who had not seen, but
      only heard of her, were in as susceptible a condition as the more
      fortunate ones. She had been graphically and dramatically described again
      and again, so that by many a one she was recognized as "the pretty sister
      of José."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what they called her&mdash;"the pretty sister of José." She heard
      it half a dozen times, but never once even so much as lifted her long
      lashes. She was so used to admiration that it was as if they spoke of some
      one else, and it moved her not in the least, as she sat watching the
      bulls, to know that bold or languishing eyes dwelt upon her face, and that
      efforts were being constantly made to attract her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a magnificent day&mdash;every one said so; there were splendid
      bulls and splendid dresses, and the fighters were in superb condition. The
      people were in good spirits too&mdash;the little breeze tempering the heat
      had, perhaps, something to do with it. Everything pleased them; they
      applauded wildly, and uttered shouts of encouragement and delight to bulls
      and toreadors alike. The grand people were richly attired; beautiful
      ladies watched with excited eyes the bulls, wearing their colors in
      rosettes of satin and glittering tinsel; the thousands of waving,
      brilliantly hued fans fluttered like a swarm of butterflies; the music
      filled the air. Pe-» pita sat in a dream of joy, the color coming and
      going on her cheeks, her rapture glowing in her eyes. She was a Spanish
      girl, and not so far in advance of her age that the terrible features of
      the pastime going on before her could obscure its brilliancy and
      excitement. Truth to tell, she entirely forgot Sebastiano, not even
      recognizing him in the pageant of the grand entry, she was so absorbed in
      its glitter and blaze of color. But at the killing of the bull, that was
      different. Just a moment before she had awakened to the fact that Manuel
      was near her&mdash;near enough to speak. He had been staring at her, and
      growing more restless every moment, until he had at last attracted the
      attention of José and Jovita, and his first words to her came amid shouts
      of applause and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sebastiano," he said; "it is Sebastiano." Pepita turned to look. With
      what a proud and careless air he advanced; with what a strong, light step;
      how he held his head and shoulders; how his gold and silver garnishings
      glittered; how the people called to him with a sort of caressing ecstasy!
      They adored him; he was their idol. Yes, there was a thrill in it, even
      for her cold heart. She felt a quick pulsation. To be so proud and
      triumphant and daring&mdash;to be the central point of everything&mdash;to
      be able to awake this exultant fervor&mdash;was something after all. And
      he was beautiful too, though she cared nothing for that, except as she
      could see that it added to his triumphs and made them more complete. His
      athletic grace of bearing, his dark, spirited face, with its passionate
      Andalusian eyes, their shadows intensified by the close, long black
      lashes, the very arch of his foot, and superb movement of his limbs, would
      have set him apart from ordinary, less fortunate mortals; but to have all
      this and be also the demi-god of these impassioned people, it must be
      worth living for. If one cared for men, if one did not find them tiresome,
      if one was simple enough&mdash;like Sarita&mdash;to be carried away by
      things, there was at least something in all this to interest one a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Sebastiano," said José.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkpresident" id="linkpresident"></a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="057 (70K)" src="images/057.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sebastiano was addressing the president of the games. He extended his
      glittering sword, and made his announcement in a clear, rich voice. Pepita
      listened as he spoke. And then the most thrilling excitement of the sport
      began. It was no child's play Sebastiano had before him. The fierce black
      bull glaring at him with bent head and fiery eyes, uttering low, muttering
      bellowings of rage as he tore at the earth, throwing up the dust in a
      cloud, was a foe worthy of his mettle. He was a bull with vicious points
      and treacherous ones. Already goaded to fury by the play of the picadors
      and banderilleros, he must be watched, studied, excited, baffled; not one
      of his movements must be lost, or even regarded as trifling; wariness,
      quickness, magnificent daring, the subtlest forethought, all were needed.
      What play it was! what a match between brute cunning, power, and ferocity,
      and human courage, adroitness, and calculation! The brilliant, graceful
      figure was scarcely a moment in repose; it leaped and darted, the bright
      cloak waving, inviting, the bright sword glittering in the sun&mdash;it
      toyed with death and peril, evading both with an exultant grace and
      swiftness marvellous to behold, and rousing the on-lookers to shouts of
      joy and triumph. Even old Jovita wakened to a touch of fire which seemed
      like a renewal of her long-past youth. José and Manuel joined their cries
      with the rest. Pepita felt again&mdash;yes, more than once&mdash;that
      sudden throb and thrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when at last the end was reached, with what a superb spring the last
      splendid blow was given! No need of a second; the bull staggered,
      shuddered, fell forward upon his knees, sank upon his side. Sebastiano
      stood erect, a brilliant, careless, triumphant figure again, the air
      resounding with deafening applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have seen him," cried Manuel to Pepita&mdash;"you have seen
      Sebastiano?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she answered, a little breathlessly, "I have seen him."
    </p>
    <p>
      And even as she spoke she knew that he had seen her; she knew it even
      before Manuel spoke again in great excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks this way&mdash;he looks at us&mdash;at you."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite true. Something had attracted his attention to the tier of
      seats in which they sat, some cry&mdash;who knows what?&mdash;perhaps some
      subtle magnetic influence. He turned his head with a quick movement, and
      his eyes fell and fastened themselves instantly upon the brilliant little
      face glowing like some bright flower among those humbler and less
      blooming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks at you, Pepita," said José.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks at you and at Jovita," Pepita answered. And she laughed and
      turned her face away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not before Sebastiano had seen it well. It was Fate. Yes, he knew
      that. He had been loved often; he had had romantic adventures, but it had
      always been he who had received and the others who had given; he had
      always remained Sebastiano, the hero, the adored. And now he stood and
      looked at a little head half concealed by a fan, and forgot for a moment
      where he was, and that the people were still shouting their applause in
      deafening tumult.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pepita and the others, Manuel with them, ended their gala-day with still
      another festivity. They dined together at a little café, and heard the
      bull-fight fought over again by those around them. At a table near them
      sat three chulos, who talked together in voices loud enough to be heard
      throughout their meal. And it was of Sebastiano they spoke, giving
      dramatic recitals of his daring deeds, telling each other of what he had
      done, of what he could do, and that Madrid had never seen his rival or
      peer. And then his conquests. It was true that noble ladies&mdash;beautiful
      and noble&mdash;had sent him messages and tokens. Gonsalvo, who was his
      intimate friend, could tell many things if he chose. Sebastiano had
      brilliant triumphs. Once he had even been in great danger because the
      woman who loved and sought him was of such rank that her relatives would
      have resorted to the stiletto rather than allow her infatuation to
      continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is said truly that he had no love for her&mdash;that he has little
      for any of them," said one. "They run after him too much, these women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there was one to-day&mdash;" began one of the others. "I heard it of
      Alfonso&mdash;he saw her at the bull-fight&mdash;Sebastiano&mdash;and
      tried to find out&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a movement at this moment which brought Pepita directly within his
      view. She had been hidden from him before by the figure of Jovita. He
      stopped with his wine untasted and stared at her. A moment later he bent
      forward and spoke in a lower tone to his companions, who turned to look
      also. Alfonso had pointed her out to him as she left the Plaza de Toros,
      and he had recognized her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The little one is there," was what he said, "behind you. He asked if any
      of us had seen her before; if we knew her name."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita did not hear him, and did not know that from that hour they would
      all know her, or that at least there would be few of them who did not. For
      Sebastiano to show an interest in a woman, to even go so far as to ask her
      name, was such a new thing that it must be spoken of and attract attention
      to her. And that she was not a fine lady, but only a pretty unknown girl
      with a rose in her hair, made the matter all the more exciting. When she
      fell asleep, tired and happy, that night, already she was on the road to
      fame. Sebastiano, who was the adored of his order, who in spite of his
      adventures sought no woman, had asked her name, had made efforts to
      discover it, and had learned that among those who had had the good fortune
      to see and speak to her she was known as "the pretty sister of José." A
      week from this time José came home one evening bringing Manuel with him.
      Manuel was often with him&mdash;in fact he had many friends; almost every
      day some gay or grave young fellow managed to attach himself to him, and
      somehow the acquaintance always shared itself soon afterward with Pepita.
      But Manuel appeared oftener than the rest, having a timid obstinacy, and
      seeming only puzzled and not discouraged by the indifference which
      sometimes ignored his very existence. On this particular evening he was
      moved from his usual calm, and so was José. They had seen Sebastiano; they
      had spoken to him; in the presence of a circle of his friends and admirers
      he had drunk wine with them. "We were passing the wine-shop and we saw
      him," explained Manuel, "and we went in to look on a little and hear him
      talk. One of the chulos who stood near spoke to him quickly when he saw us&mdash;as
      if he knew us&mdash;and presently the same chulo came and spoke to José,
      and soon Sebastiano came and spoke too. The one who approached us first
      was one of the three who drank at the table near us on the evening after
      the bull-fight. Once, in his boyhood, Sebastiano lived near the village
      you left; he knew Padre Alejandro and some others; he was pleased to see
      José and speak of them&mdash;it was as if they were friends at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has a good heart," put in José; "they all say that of him. He
      remembered everything&mdash;even old Juan, who lived to be a hundred and
      was bent double. He asked if he lived yet. It seems strange that he was
      once so near us, and was a little lad, ill-used and poor. He is not too
      proud to remember it. He would be a good friend to one in trouble&mdash;Sebastiano&mdash;though
      he is rich and spoken of by the whole world."
    </p>
    <p>
      So great a celebrity José was convinced must be known to the entire
      universe. That night, as Pepita made ready for her bed, old Jovita, who
      had already retired, lay and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood in the flood of brilliant white moonlight which bathed part
      of the bare room; her round dimpled arms were lifted as she unwound the
      soft dusky coils of her hair, to which there yet clung a few stars of
      jasmine. There was the shadow of a smile on her lips, and she was humming
      a tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he want with José&mdash;this Sebastiano?" said Jovita,
      grumblingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who knows?" said Pepita.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wants something," Jovita went on. "They don't make friends with those
      beneath them for nothing, these fine ones. They all talk of you, these
      foolish fellows, and he has heard, and makes friends so that he can see
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do they say of me?" asked
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita, without deigning to look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men are all fools," grumbled Jovita; "and they think girls are fools too.
      They say you have a pretty face; and he thinks he can make a fool of you
      if you are not one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he?" said Pepita, with a dimpling cruel little smile. "Let him come
      to-morrow&mdash;to-night. Let him begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will begin soon enough," Jovita answered. "You will see. Be sure he
      does not play the old game with you as he did with Sarita."
    </p>
    <p>

      alt="Shook the Small Stray Blossoms out of Her Hair 069 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Pepita shook the small stray blossoms out of her hair and began to retwist
      the coil, breaking into singing in a clear voice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "White, white is the jasmine flower;
     Let its stars light thee
     Here to my casement,
     Where I await thee.
        White, white is the jasmine flower,
     Sweet, sweet is the heart of the rose,
     Sweet my mouth's blossom&mdash;"
</pre>
    <p>
      She stopped short and dropped her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See," she said, "let him want what he will, let him come a thousand
      times, and I will never speak to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gardens the next Sunday they met him. Pepita was talking to a young
      girl whose name was Isabella, and whose brother. Juan was following in the
      footsteps of Manuel and the rest. It was Isabella who first saw the
      matador, and uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your brother is coming," she cried, "with&mdash;yes, with Sebastiano."
    </p>
    <p>
      José's simple face was on fire with delight, but Sebastiano looked less
      gay, and his step was less carelessly buoyant than it had been in the
      bull-ring. As he approached the group he looked only at Pepita. But Pepita
      looked only at José, her eyes laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jovita is cross," she said; "she has been asking for you. She wishes to
      go home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sebastiano's eyes were fastened upon her face, upon her red lips, as she
      spoke. He had heard that she was like this; that she gave her glances to
      no man; that she was prettier than the rose in bloom, and as cruel as a
      young hawk, and his heart beat as he found himself near to her. Since the
      hour he had seen her he had thought only of how he might see her again, of
      how he might find her. He had made one bold plan after another, and had
      been forced to abandon each of them, and then mere chance had thrown José
      in his path. And now the instant he approached her she was about to elude
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke a few hurried words to José. It was too early to go away; the
      pleasure of the day was scarcely at its height; he wished to entertain
      them; they must not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go and speak to Jovita," said José, and he went, leaving the four
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two simpler ones were somewhat abashed by the splendor of the dashing
      figure; they gazed at it with mingled curiosity and joy. To be so near it
      was enough, without effort at conversation. Sebastiano moved to Pepita's
      side. A Spanish lover loses little time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw you," he said, "at the bull-fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita looked over his shoulder and smiled at a passing woman who had
      greeted her. Her face dimpled, and she showed her small white teeth. It
      was as if she did not see the matador at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was at the bull-fight," he persisted. "Two weeks ago. You had a red
      flower in your hair, as you have to-day. Ever since&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not true," Pepita said gayly, to Isabella, "what I said of Jovita.
      She is always cross, but she does not wish to go home. She met an old
      woman she knew in her young days, and is enjoying herself very much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you say it?" asked Isabella, with simple wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I wished to go home myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly!" said Isabella. "Why is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not entertained so much to-day," answered Pepita.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004">

    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/075.jpg" alt="We Will Make It More Amusing 075 "
      width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      "We will make it more amusing," said Sebastiano, eagerly. "It shall be
      more amusing&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is Jovita with her old woman now," interrupted Pepita. "I will go
      and speak to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was gone the next instant&mdash;her movement was like the flight of a
      bird. Sebastiano stood and stared after her in silence until Juan
      addressed him respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is very wonderful," he said. "She changes her mind before one knows.
      Just before you came she said she was amused, and wished to remain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," began Sebastiano, much discomforted&mdash;"perhaps it was I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, senor," said Juan, with great politeness, "never. It is said that she
      always does what she chooses, and she chooses to do a thousand things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is because she is so pretty," said Isabella. "She is so much
      prettier than all the others, and she does not care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman who is so pretty as that," remarked Juan, sententiously, "need
      not care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She says," put in Isabella, "that if she does not care, others will; but
      if she should care, the others&mdash;" She stopped, meeting Sebastiano's
      eyes and becoming a little confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would happen then," he said, "if she should care?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," said Isabella; "but she never will&mdash;never."
    </p>
    <p>
      But if she changed often toward others, Sebastiano found no change in her
      mood toward him. They did not leave the gardens until late in the day.
      Jovita was enjoying too greatly the comradeship of her old woman, and was
      ready to enjoy any pleasure offered to her. Sebastiano had a full purse,
      and perhaps understood old women of Jovita's class. He made himself very
      agreeable to these two, finding them the most comfortable seats and
      supplying them with things good to eat and drink, over which they gossiped
      together, leaving the young ones to amuse themselves as they pleased. They
      were very gay, the younger ones; even Manuel, elated by the presence and
      hospitalities of Sebastiano, made little jokes. But none of them were
      gayer than Pepita. She was the centre figure of the party; they all looked
      at her, listened to her, were led by her slightest caprice. They went here
      and there, did this or that, because she wished it. It was Sebastiano who
      was the host of the hour, but by instinct each knew it was Pepita who was
      the chief guest&mdash;who must be pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she pleased?" the matador asked José once in a low-toned aside. "Does
      she not entertain herself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she not say so?" answered José, with some slight secret misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," said Sebastiano, looking down. "She does not speak to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      José pushed his hat aside and rubbed his forehead. His respect for
      Pepita's whims had begun early in life and was founded on experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is young," he faltered&mdash;"she is very young. When she enjoys
      herself she&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused with an uneasy movement of his shoulders. It was quite terrible
      to him that she should treat with such caprice and disdain so splendid and
      heroic a person; but he knew there was nothing to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She admires you," he said, with courageous mendacity. "She saw you at the
      bullfight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will be there again? You will take her&mdash;the next time?" said
      Sebastiano.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," answered José. "She has asked that I will. It was the greatest
      pleasure of her life."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was true that during all the afternoon she had never once spoken to
      Sebas-tiano. She had been as gay as a young bird, and the spirit of the
      party, her laughter, her pretty mockeries and sauciness, had carried all
      before them. Manuel had been reduced to hopeless slavery. Isabella had
      looked on in secret reverential wonder. Jovita's old woman had glanced
      aside again and again, nodding her head, and saying, sagely: "Yes, she
      will always have it her own way&mdash;the little one. You are lucky in
      having such a grandchild. She will never be a load." But throughout it all
      Pepita had managed it that not one of her words had fallen directly to
      Sebastiano. If he spoke to her, she gave her answer to the one nearest to
      him. If he did not put an actual question to her, she replied merely with
      a laugh or a piquant grimace or gesture, which included all the rest. It
      was worse than coldness. To the others it was perhaps not perceptible at
      all; only he who searched for her eyes, who yearned and strove to meet
      them, knew that they never rested upon him for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then when he so daringly arranged that José should invite him to
      return home with them, to what did it all come? He was lured to old
      Jovita's side by the fact that at the beginning of the walk Pepita kept
      near her, and no sooner had the old woman involved him in tiresome talk,
      from which he could not escape, than the small figure flitted away and
      ended the journey homeward under the wing of José, and accompanied by
      Manuel and a certain gay little Carlos, who joked and laughed like a
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when after they arrived, and the moon rose, and they sat under the
      vines, though there was gayety and laughter, he knew, as before, that in
      some mysterious manner he was excluded from it, though he seemed the
      honored and distinguished guest. Carlos, who sat near some shrubs in
      bloom, made a little wreath of white flowers, and as she played and sang
      to her guitar, Pepita wore it on her head. Then Manuel, not to be outdone,
      wove a garland of pink oleander, and she threw it about her throat and
      sang on. Sebastiano forgot at last to speak, and could only sit and look
      at her. He could see and hear nothing else. It was almost the same thing
      with the rest, for that matter. She was somehow the centre figure round
      which they all seemed to have gathered, as she sat there playing, a night
      breeze sometimes stirring the soft ruffled hair on her forehead, which was
      like black floss silk; and whatsoever she sang, however passionate and
      tender the wild little song, however passionate and tender her voice, her
      young eyes had mockery in them&mdash;mocked at the words, the tenderness
      of her own voice, and at those who were moved by it; and most of all
      Sebastiano knew that she mocked at himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not go away. Some strange thing had happened to him, it
      seemed; it was as if a spell had fallen upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Better to be mocked than to go away. He stayed so late that Jovita fell
      asleep and nodded under the shadow of the grape-vines. And at last Pepita
      put down her guitar and rose. She stood upright in the moonlight, and
      extended her pretty arms and stretched them, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night," she said. "Jovita will amuse you. Already there have been
      too many hours in this day."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran into the house with no other adieu than a wave of her hand, and
      the next minute they could hear her singing in her room, and knew she was
      going to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sebastiano rose slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night," he said to José.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manuel and Carlos said good-night also, and went out together, walking
      side by side down the white moonlit road; but Sebas-tiano moved away from
      the shadowing vines with a lingering step, and José went with him a short
      distance. Something in his hero's air of gravity and abstraction somewhat
      overawed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has not been entertained," said Sebastiano at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," said José. "She has had pleasure all the day. And she is fond
      of pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She said there had been too many hours in the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      José rubbed his head a little reflectively for a moment, and then his
      countenance somewhat brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She wished to lie a little for amusement," he said, affectionately.
      "There is no wrong in her&mdash;Pepita&mdash;but sometimes, to be amused,
      she will tell a little lie without sin in it, because she knows we
      understand her. She does not expect us to believe. We who are used to her
      know her better. You will also understand in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I may come again?" asked Sebas-tiano.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy body of José almost trembled with simple pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all yours, senor," he said, with a gesture including the little
      house and all the grape-vines and orange blossoms and oleanders. "It is
      poor and small, but it is yours&mdash;and we&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sebastiano's dark eyes rested for an instant on a little window under the
      eaves where a jasmine vine wreathed a thick tangle of green, starred with
      white flowers. And as he looked a voice broke through the fragrant barrier
      singing a careless, broken bit of song&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "White, white is the jasmine flower;
     Let its stars light thee."
</pre>
    <p>
      "It is Pepita," said José. "She always sings when she is pleased. It is
      always a good sign."
    </p>
    <p>
      If her singing was a sign of pleasure, then she must have been enjoying
      her life greatly in the days that came afterward, for she was singing
      continually. As she went about her work there was always the shadow of a
      smile on her lips and in her eyes, as if her thoughts amused her. And she
      was in such gay spirits that José was enchanted. He had only one vague
      source of trouble: all the rest had turned out so well! It had all
      occurred just as he had dreamed, but scarcely dared to hope, in those
      by-gone days when he had been hard-worked and ill-fed and ill-clad. He had
      a good place, and what seemed by comparison incredibly good wages. He had
      the nice little house, and Pepita had holiday garments as gay and pretty
      as any other girl, and looked, when dressed in them, gayer and ten times
      prettier than all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what he had looked forward to most of all, and his end was
      attained. And when he walked out with her, all the young fellows who were
      allowed to come near&mdash;and many who were not&mdash;fell in love. Yes,
      it was true; he saw it himself and heard it on every side. It would take
      the fingers of both hands to count those who were frankly enamoured,
      beginning with Carlos and Manuel. But it was at this point that the vague
      trouble came in. And it was Pepita herself who caused it, by her treatment
      of her adorers. To say that she dealt out scorn to them would be to say
      too much; she simply dealt out nothing&mdash;and less. They might come and
      go; they might follow and gaze and sigh&mdash;she did not even deign to
      seem to know they did so, unless by chance one became too pertinacious,
      and then she merely transfixed him with a soft, cruelly smiling eye. "She
      will not marry any of them," said José to Jovita in bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will come soon enough," said Jovita. "She is pretty, and it makes
      her a little fool&mdash;all girls are like that; but one of these days you
      may look out&mdash;it will be all over. She is just the one to blaze up
      all at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think she is a fool like other girls," said José, with gravity.
      "But she does not seem to care about love; she does not seem to know. She
      is not even sorry for them when they are miserable." He did not consider
      himself when he thought of her marriage; in truth he put himself in the
      background, for if some other man filled her life and her heart his
      vocation would be gone, and there would be some dull hours for him before
      he could become used to it. But he had an innocent feeling that without
      this love, of which all men talked so much, the life he wished to be
      bright would not be quite complete. She was too pretty and too good never
      to be married&mdash;never to have a home of her own and some fine fellow
      to love the dust she walked on. He himself was only José, and a brother
      was, after all, a poor substitute for a lover who could talk and sing and
      make jokes, and wear such a dashing air that she would be proud of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is it," he said, sagely, to himself. "A woman must have some one to
      be proud of, and she could never be proud of me. If I were Sebastiano now,
      it would be different."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly and rubbed his head, as his habit was when he was
      startled or confused, and his face became rather red. Perhaps this was
      because he remembered that among all the rest, the magnificent, the
      illustrious, the beautiful Sebastiano was the one to whom she showed least
      grace. In fact it was almost mysterious, her manner toward him. They had
      seen him often&mdash;he had come in many evenings to sit under the vines;
      when they went out for pleasure it somehow happened that they nearly
      always met him; but when he joined them Pepita became at once possessed of
      some strange wilful spirit. Upon reflection José found that he had never
      yet heard her speak to him: it appeared to him as he thought it over that
      she always by some device avoided answering directly what he said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a strange thing," said José, deeply mystified, as he suddenly
      realized this, "when one remembers how he can slay a bull. There is no one
      else who can slay a bull as he can. It is enough to make one weep for joy.
      And yet she can treat him ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not know how ill; only Sebas-tiano knew that. Since the day he
      had stood in the arena and had seen all in a moment, as if a star had
      suddenly started into the sky, the small black head and rose of a face, he
      had lived in a fevered dream&mdash;a dream in which he pursued always
      something which seemed within his grasp and yet forever eluded him. What
      had he cared for all the rest of the women? Nothing. It had confused and
      angered him when they had thrown themselves in his way or sent him
      offerings, and when he had been told of this or that beauty who was in
      love with his proud, bearing and dashing courage. Women! What were women?
      He had only cared for the bulls, for the clamor of the people, and the
      wild excitement of the arena. All he had wished for was to learn the best
      stroke, the finest leap. But this girl, who had never opened her scornful
      little mouth to deign him a word&mdash;who had never once allowed him to
      look in her eyes&mdash;somehow this one drove him half mad. He could think
      of nothing else; he forgot even the bulls; he spent all the day and
      sometimes all the night in devising plans to entrap her into speaking, to
      force her to look at him. How obstinate she was! How she could elude him,
      as if by some magic!
    </p>
    <p>
      What had he not done that he might be near her? He had followed her
      everywhere. José did not know that she scarcely ever went out without his
      following and speaking to her. He used to spring up by her side as if he
      had risen out of the earth, but after the first two or three times he
      never succeeded in making her start or show any feeling whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that first time, and even the second, she had started. The first time
      she had gone to the old well for water, and as she stood resting in the
      shade a moment he appeared With a bouquet of beautiful strange flowers in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God be with you!" he said, and laid the flowers down a moment and drew
      the water for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him draw it, smiling just a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be a fine day for the bull-fight," he said, when her jar was
      filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand up and shaded her working eyes as she looked at the blue
      sky, but she said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you go to-day to the Plaza de Toros?" he asked. "You shall have good
      places&mdash;the best. They are good bulls to-day, black Andalusians,
      fierce and hard to manage. There will be fine sport. You will go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005">

    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/095.jpg"
      alt="She Leaned Against the Side of The Well 095 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      She leaned against the side of the well and looked down into the water,
      where she could see her face reflected in the cool, dark depths. The next
      moment Sebastiano's was reflected also. He held the flowers in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These!" he said. "It was one of the gardeners of the king who gave them
      to me. They are such as the queen sometimes wears. I brought them that you
      might wear them at the bull-fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw their beauty reflected in the water. She would not look at them
      directly. They were very beautiful. She had never seen such flowers. And
      the queen herself had worn others like them. If any one else had brought
      them&mdash;but it was Sebastiano. And she remembered Sarita. Perhaps he
      had at some time given some to Sarita, knowing that to a country girl who
      knew nothing they would seem very grand. Sarita would have been sure to
      take them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wicked little look came into her face. She turned as if to take up her
      water jar. But Sebastiano laid his hand upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not speak," he said passionately. "No; nor even look at the
      flowers I bring you. You shall tell me at least what I have done. Come,
      now. Am I a devil? What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hands behind her back and fixed her great eyes upon him for a
      moment. He could not say now that she had not looked at him. He thought he
      could keep her, did he, when she did not choose to stay? She, Pepita! She
      stood there staring at him for a moment, and then turned about and walked
      off, leaving him with her water jar. Let him stand and watch over it all
      day if he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back to the house and called Jovita.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you want your water now," she said, "you will have to go to the well
      for it. It is drawn, and Senor Sebastiano is taking care of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother of God!" said Jovita, staring, "she is mad with her Senor
      Sebastiano."
    </p>
    <p>
      But not another word could she gain, and before she could reach the well
      she met a boy carrying the water jar toward the house, and was told that
      he had been paid to bring it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the bull-fight; and, as Pepita sat among the rest,
      out-blooming the red flower in her hair, she heard it said that Sebastiano
      had never before been so magnificent, had never shown such daring and
      dexterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks at Pepita," said Isabella to Carlos. "When he entered, his eyes
      found her before he saw anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he saw Pepita, and Pepita sat and watched him with as cool an
      interest as if the peril with which he played meant nothing. Her lovely
      eyes glowed under their drooping lashes, but it was only with a momentary
      excitement caused by the fierce sport; the man was nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it seemed at least to Sebastiano. It was a bad bull he encountered,
      savage and treacherous, and maddened by his rage. Once there was a moment
      when a shadow of a misstep would have cost him his life. There was no time
      to look at Pepita then, but when the danger was passed and he glanced
      toward her, she was softly waving her fan and smiling up at Manuel as if
      she had not even seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has a bad heart," he said to himself, with fierce impatience. "It is
      not nature that a young girl should mock at everything, and be so cruel,
      and have neither feeling nor even a little fear. She has a bad heart, or
      none at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not look at her again; he swore it to himself. And for a short
      time he kept his vow; but there came a moment when something, some
      irresistible feeling, conquered him. It was as if he must look&mdash;as if
      some magic forced him, drew his eyes toward her in spite of himself. And
      when he had looked, a sharp shock thrilled him, for she herself was
      looking at him; her eyes were fixed upon him with a strange steadiness, as
      if perhaps they had been resting upon him for some minutes and she had
      forgotten herself. It was a little thing perhaps, but it was enough for
      his hot blood and swift-veering impulsive nature. He had just given the
      final stroke; he was panting, glowing. The people were shouting, rising in
      their seats, and repeating his name with caressing, applauding epithets
      attached to it. Chance had brought him near the seat in which she sat,
      with Jovita and José and the others near her. They were applauding with
      the rest, all but Pepita, who only sat and smiled. And in the midst of it
      Sebastiano made a swift movement, so swift that it was scarcely to be
      understood&mdash;a mere touch of the hand to the shoulder&mdash;and
      something bright, like a many-hued bird, flew over the barrier and fell
      upon Pepita's lap. It was the knot of gay, rich ribbon which a moment
      before the matador had worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the <i>devisa!</i>" exclaimed Isabella, in an awestruck tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is his <i>devisa</i>," cried José&mdash;"his <i>devisa</i>, Pepita. He
      has thrown it to you yourself&mdash;Sebastiano."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he was struck dumb with amazement. Pepita sat upright and
      broke into a little laugh. She lightly waved her fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did he not throw it to Jovita?" she said, and with a cruel, careless
      little movement she swept the <i>devisa</i> from her knee; it fell, and
      she set her foot upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has trodden upon it," said old Jovita. "She has done it for pride,
      and to show herself above others. She is ready for the devil. Some one
      should beat her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the <i>devisa</i>," gasped José. "Sebastiano."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita left her seat. It seemed as if something strange must have happened
      to her. The crimson had leaped to her cheeks, and her eyes were ablaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it to me, his <i>devisa?</i>" she said. "I do not want it. I will
      not have it. Let him throw a thousand, and I will tread upon them all, one
      after the other. Let it lie in the dirt. Let him give it to those others,
      those women who want it&mdash;and him." She would go home at once; not to
      the pleasure-gardens, not anywhere but back to the cottage; and José
      followed her meekly, struck dumb. He had seen her wilful, capricious,
      childishly passionate, a little hard to understand, many times before, but
      never like this. What had occurred to her? What had Sebastiano done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jovita had picked up the knot of gay ribbon and brushed the dust off it,
      and carried it home with her, grumbling fiercely. She was never averse to
      grumbling a little, and here, the saints knew, was cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For pride," she kept repeating; "for pride, and to show that others are
      beneath her! Mother of God! the king himself is not good enough for her!
      Let him come and pray upon his knees that she will go to the palace and
      wear a crown, and he will see what she will say! It is these fools of men
      who spoil her, as if there had never been a pretty face before. Let them
      treat her as she treats them, and she will be humble enough. She was
      always one of the devil's children with her pride!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pepita, who heard it all, said nothing, though once or twice she gave
      her little mocking laugh.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      By the time Pepita had reached home her mood had changed&mdash;her anger
      was gone, or at least the signs of it were. She sang as she prepared the
      supper, and chatted gayly with José. It appeared that, after all, she had
      enjoyed the bull-fight; it had even been better than the others; she had
      had great pleasure. She made delightful little jests about everything; she
      recounted the names of the people she had seen and known; she described to
      him the dresses of the girls, the airs and graces of the men. She laughed,
      and obliged José to laugh also, and all the time she looked so pretty,
      with the queer light in her eyes, the gleam of her little wicked white
      teeth, and the brilliant spot of color on her cheeks, that she was enough
      to turn one's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was at its brightest that night. All the earth was bathed in
      pure, magic whiteness&mdash;the whiteness which somehow seems to bring
      perfume and stillness and mysterious tenderness with it. Such a night! One
      breathed roses and orange blossoms and jasmine. Pepita sat under the roses
      and sang and talked, and José smoked and was happy, but still in a state
      of bewilderment, though the stillness and beauty of the night soothed him
      and made him content to ruminate without words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jovita fell asleep. She always fell asleep out-of-doors on the warm summer
      nights, and in-doors by the fire when it was winter. Pepita ceased to
      talk, and sang one little song after another; then she even ceased to
      sing, and only touched her guitar softly now and then. After a while José,
      who had stretched himself upon a bench, fell asleep also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita ceased to touch her guitar. She looked out at the flowers sleeping
      in the moonlight, and for a few minutes was very still; then she laid the
      guitar down and stepped out into the brightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the light of the moon one cannot see the color in a face. Perhaps this
      was why hers seemed to be gone. She looked quite pale, and her lovely
      little brows were drawn together until they made a black line across her
      forehead. She clasped her hands behind her head, and with her face a
      little thrown back, so that the light fell full upon it, wandered out
      among the trees and fragrant flowering things. She liked the jasmine best,
      and over one part of the low, rough wall there climbed one which blossomed
      with a myriad stars. So she went and stood by it, and looked now at it,
      now up and down the road, which the moon had made into a path of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as she stood there, suddenly there started up on the other side of the
      wall the figure she knew so well, and the next moment it had vaulted over
      and was close to her. Sebastiano!
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood still, her hands still clasped behind her head, her face still
      upturned, and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      He folded his arms and looked at her. As for him, whether the moonlight
      was to blame or not, he was as pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, "you are always the same. You do not change. One may come
      at any hour. But listen to me. You think I have come to reproach you. Why
      should I? I have fought bulls, but that does not teach men how to deal
      with women. I thought that, if a man gave you his soul and his life and
      the breath of his body, you would listen some day and let him think of
      you. You are a woman, and you are made to be loved; but there is something
      hard in your heart. You are proud of having mocked a man who was honest
      and loved you. But hear me: it is better, after all, to be less pretty and
      more a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped an instant. She had changed her position, and stood by the
      jasmine, stripping the blossoms from it one by one. She began to smile and
      sing softly, as if to herself:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Oh, bird at my window,
     Sing but one song to me,
     My lover who is light and gay."
</pre>
    <p>
      "And more a woman," said Sebastiano. "It is women men want."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita looked up and laughed; then she sang again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Who stirs the blossoms in the night,
     Who breaks the orange flower."
</pre>
    <p>
      Sebastiano made a swift movement and caught her wrists, his eyes flashing
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is nothing," he said. "You are woman enough. The time will come. It
      will not be always like this. You can be <i>made</i> to love. Yes, you are
      one of those who must be <i>made</i>. Then you will suffer too, and it
      will be good for you. You will speak then."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, and held her arms a little apart, looking at her with
      a sudden change to mournfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How pretty you are!" he said. "How little and how pretty! If you were
      good and gentle, and one might touch your cheek softly or stroke your
      hair, how one would love and serve you! No, you cannot move. I have not
      fought bulls for nothing. If I let you move you will struggle and hurt
      yourself. Listen. I am going away. I will trouble you no more now. I will
      wait. If one waits long enough, pain ceases and one forgets. It is so with
      a wound, why not with what one feels for a woman? I said you could be <i>made</i>
      to love; but let that be left for another man to do. I want no love like
      that. I want a woman. Some day you will not cast the <i>devisa</i> under
      your feet. You will take it and hide it in your breast. It will not be
      mine, but some other man's who loves you less. I loved you, I was mad for
      you; but it shall cease. It is better to think only of the bulls than to
      play the fool for a woman who has no love in her heart. You are pretty,
      but that is not everything. You can work spells, but a man can break
      through them. There! Go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her one long look, flung her hands aside, and had vaulted the wall
      and was gone himself one moment later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita stood still with clinched hands dropped at her side, staring with
      wide fierce eyes down the white moonlit road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening José came home from his work later than usual. He came
      down the road with a drooping head and a slow and heavy step. When he sat
      down to his food he ate but little, and as he bent over his soup he heard
      Jovita scolding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is gone," she was saying. "You took it, and have thrown it away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it not mine?" said Pepita. "It was mine. I cared nothing for it, and
      have done what I chose with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      José lifted his head and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has thrown away the <i>devisa</i>, which I had saved," answered
      Jovita. "I laid it away, and she has taken it. What harm did it do her
      that it should lie out of her sight in peace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you do that?" José said to Pepita.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it meant for her?" said Pepita. "I told you he ought to have thrown
      it to her and not to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      José broke a piece of bread and crumbled it on the table mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not have done that," he said. "I wish you had left it in its
      place. It did no hurt, and we shall not see him again. He is not coming
      any more. And soon he goes away; and who knows what may happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita walked out of the house without speaking. She did not come back for
      a long time, and they did not know where she had gone; but as that was her
      way when she was in a naughty humor, they were not anxious about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she returned at last the moon was shining again, and Jovita was
      asleep in the shadow of the vines, and José sat on the bench outside the
      door, smoking.
    </p>

      width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Pepita sat down on the threshold and rested her head against the side of
      the door. She said nothing at all, and only looked out at the dew-laden
      flowers sparkling in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for several minutes, and then José turned uneasily and
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, "he will not come again; and soon he goes away. It is for
      the best. He is very strong and determined. Perhaps that comes of fighting
      bulls. He said he wanted you, but you did not want him, so he must forget
      about you. He must cease to think of you or hear of you. He asked me as a
      friend not to let him see me for a while, until it was over. To see me
      would remind him of you, and that would not do. He asked it as a friend&mdash;there
      was no unkind-ness&mdash;he is my friend, yes, though he is Sebastiano and
      I am only a poor fellow who works hard. It will all be as well as ever
      between us when it is all done with and we meet again. If you had wanted
      him we should have been brothers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita sat still. What strange thing had happened to her? She did not
      know. Something was the matter with her breathing. Something hurt her side&mdash;labored
      in it with heavy beatings like blows which suffocated her. She shut her
      hands and drove the nails into her palms. She could not have spoken for
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before José could say more she rose with fierce suddenness, and passed him
      and was gone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow looked after her small swift form mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she had wanted him," he said, "he would have made her a good husband,
      and we should have been brothers. But she is not easy to please, and she
      would not give one a chance who did not please her at first. And there is
      no one who slays a bull as he does!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita flew like a bird until she reached the low wall where the jasmine
      grew, at the spot where she had stood the night before. There she stopped,
      panting. The breath of the jasmine filled all the air about her. She
      looked up the white road.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange new passion filled her. She did not know whether it was anger or
      not, but if it was anger it was of a new kind, with more pain in it than
      she was used to. He would not come again&mdash;not at all again! He would
      not appear at her side as if he had sprung from the earth; he would not
      follow her or plead with her, or look at her every moment he was near her;
      he would not try to make her speak. Only last night he was here in this
      very spot, and now he would never speak like that again. He would forget
      her, not care for her&mdash;forget her, Pepita.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not believe it. She knew he could not&mdash;they never did; they
      always loved her best and wanted no one else. And still the labored
      throbbing went on in her side and she panted for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back," she cried, looking up the white road. "I tell you to come
      back. You shall. Do you hear? I tell you&mdash;I&mdash;Pepita!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no answer, no sound of any footstep, no sign of any
      advancing shadow. The road stretched out its white length in utter
      solitude, and a strange, wild look came into her beautiful little face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not hear?" she persisted. "I will not speak to you if you do come;
      I will give you nothing; I will not look at you; but you shall come
      because I will it&mdash;because I am Pepita."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still there was only silence and loneliness. Suddenly she flung out her
      hands and stamped her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will kill you," she said. "If you do not come&mdash;I will kill you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then almost immediately she put her clinched hand to her beating side and
      sank down upon the earth, burying her face in the dew-wet fragrant tangle
      of the jasmine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not come back. And yet every night she went and stood by the
      low wall, and looked up the white road and watched and waited. For a long
      time she did not know what she intended to do if he should appear. All was
      vague in her mind. At first it seemed only as if her whole being went out
      into the fierce demand that he should come, and the obstinate proud belief
      that it must be as she wished&mdash;that he could not resist and disobey
      her. Who had ever disobeyed her? Not José; not Jovita, for all her
      grumblings; not any of those others. And was it likely that he who had
      adored her more than all the rest, who had watched her with that hungry
      love in his eyes, could do what no other had ever done? She told herself
      this over and over again; but he did not come. She began to feel a
      feverish eagerness when she dressed herself, a passionate desire to be
      pretty&mdash;to be prettier than ever before. She used to stand before her
      scrap of looking-glass to try on one bit of simple finery after another,
      twisting up the soft cloud of her hair afresh a dozen times a day, and
      putting a fresh flower in it. She went to the well again and again and
      filled her jar, and emptied and filled it again, and lingered, and tried
      not to look round when she heard a footstep; but the right one never came,
      though her heart's throbbing shook her many times in false alarm. She was
      only a child&mdash;a passionate Spanish child, ignorant and full of fierce
      young natural impulses&mdash;and she knew only childish, crude methods. So
      she made herself beautiful, and showed herself in the places where she
      thought he would see her and be unable to resist her will and her beauty;
      but though she made José take her here and there and everywhere, she never
      saw Sebastiano but once. It was in the Public Garden, where they had first
      met. They were sitting in the shade refreshing themselves with wine, and
      he came toward them, not at first seeing them. Pepita clutched her fan
      until she broke it, and a wild exultation sprang in her breast. She had
      seen before she left home that she had never before been so pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had come into her face a new look&mdash;a fire that had burned
      deeper every charm. He would see&mdash;he would see that she was Pepita
      still, and that he could not keep his word if she chose&mdash;if she
      chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew nearer and nearer, still not seeing them. He was talking to the
      three companions who were with him. He was richly dressed, and looked
      stronger than ever, and more handsome and graceful. He came still nearer.
      No, she would not speak to him. No! He looked up and his eye fell upon
      them&mdash;upon José and Jovita and Pepita! He drew back a step and stood
      still; he made a low bow to them, a grand bow, such as he made when he was
      in the bull-ring and the people applauded. He turned away and passed on.
      Yes, without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jose sighed a deep and mournful sigh and rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," he said. "We must go. It is best not to stay. He does not wish to
      see us, and he asked that I would keep away. It is a pity&mdash;but he
      asked it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The breath was coming in sharp little puffs through Pepita's delicate
      nostrils. It was as if she had been struck a blow. She walked home as in a
      sort of delirium; she saw none of those who turned to look at her. She
      walked faster and faster. Jovita could not keep pace with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter?" said the old woman. "You walk as if you had a devil
      in you. Your breath is all gone. Are you mad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, when they sat together, Pepita spoke of the next bull-fight.
      José must take her. She wished to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is better that we should not go there," said José. "You know why. He
      will not like to see you. You saw how it was to-day. He is not angry, only
      he is determined not to be reminded. Soon he will go away, and then you
      shall go with me as often as you wish; but not now. After this week he
      will be far away&mdash;far away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go now," said Pepita. "I will go without you if you will not take
      me. Isabella and Juan and Manuel will be glad enough. Let him&mdash;let
      him look at his bulls."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know that it was desperation that had seized upon her; she
      thought it was defiance. Yes, yes, she told herself, breathlessly, he
      should see her laugh and talk with Manuel and Carlos and Juan and the
      rest; and then he would be punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would hear nothing that José said. She would go&mdash;she would go. No
      other bull-fight but this would please her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could scarcely live until the day arrived. She had made for herself a
      new gala dress; she had a new fan and a necklace she had bought out of her
      little savings.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great crowd. It was known that Sebastiano was to go away, and
      many had come for that reason, wishing to see him for the last time in the
      season.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Pepita was gayer than her adorers had ever seen her. She deigned
      to talk and smile and listen. She had the restlessness and color of some
      brilliant-winged bird. Isabella looked at her in wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was never like this before," she whispered to Juan.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Sebastiano came, and for the time they saw only him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last the bull lay an inert mass in the dust, and the people
      shouted and almost flung themselves from their places into the arena in
      their excitement, and the gay and superb actor bowed to them&mdash;bowed
      to them again and again&mdash;Pepita sat like a little image of stone. She
      was quite colorless, and her eyes were fixed. She seemed to hear and see
      nothing until some one spoke to her. Then she rose and looked at Manuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too hot," she said, in a low voice not like her own. "I must go.
      The sun. I have a pain in my head. Come."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not lifted his eyes once to her. It was as if she had not lived&mdash;as
      if she had been Isabella or Carmenita&mdash;and he did not give her a
      thought. No, he had not once looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he was gone. She heard José say so to Jovita, who grumbled
      loudly. She had forgotten her old distaste for these "fine ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And but for her humors he would have stayed," she said. "What more does
      she want than a fine well-built man like that&mdash;a man who is
      well-to-do, and whom every other girl would dance for joy to get? But no;
      nothing but a prince for her. Well, we shall see. She will work for her
      bread herself at last, and serve the other women who have homes and
      husbands."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night she was wakened from her slumbers by something&mdash;she
      knew not what. Soon she perceived it was Pepita, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it now?" demanded the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stayed out in the dew too long," said Pepita, "and I am cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is well," said Jovita. "Get chilled through and have a fever, that
      we may ruin ourselves with doctors' bills; and all because you choose to
      remain in the night air when you should be asleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita lay on her pillow, her eyes wide open in the darkness, her small
      hot hand clutching against her breast something she had hung round her
      neck by a bit of ribbon. It was the <i>devisa</i> she had stolen from
      Jovita, and which had not been thrown away at all. In the daytime it was
      hidden in the bosom of her dress; at night it hung by a cord and her hand
      held it. By this time a sort of terror had mingled itself with her passion
      of anger and pain, and she lay trembling because she was saying to herself
      again and again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am like Sarita! I am like Sarita!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said it to herself a thousand times in the weeks and months which
      followed, and which seemed to her helplessness like years. She said it in
      as many moods as there were hours of the day. Sometimes with wild
      unreasoning childish rage; sometimes with a shock of fear; sometimes in a
      frenzy of shame; sometimes, as she stood and looked up the road, her
      cheeks pale, her eyes dilated with self-pity and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am like Sarita! Yes&mdash;Sarita!" She remembered with superstitious
      tremor all the things that had been said to her of the punishment that
      would fall upon her because of her hard-heartedness. She remembered
      Jovita's prophecies, and how she had mocked them; how cruel she had been
      to those who suffered for her; how she had laughed in their faces and
      turned away from their sighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered Felipe, whom she had not spared one pang&mdash;Felipe, at
      whom she had only stared in scorn when he wept and wrung his hands before
      her. Had he felt like this when she sent him back to Seville to despair?
    </p>
    <p>
      A cruel fever of restlessness burned her. She could find pleasure no more
      in the novelties of the city, in the gayeties of the gardens, in her own
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she was sure it was magic&mdash;the evil-eye. And she slipped
      away, poor child! and knelt in the still, cool church, and prayed to be
      delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But once as she was doing this a sudden thought struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to think of him any more," she said, knitting her brows with yet
      another new pang. "Not to remember his face&mdash;not to remember his
      voice and the words he said! No, no!" And her rosary slipped from her
      fingers and fell upon the stone floor, and she picked it up and rose from
      her knees and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day and night she thought and thought, and the next day went to
      pray again&mdash;but not that she might be delivered. She brought to the
      shrine at which she knelt substantial promises as offerings. Hers were not
      the prayers of a saint, but of a passionate, importunate child,
      self-willed and tempestuous. She would not have prayed if she could have
      hoped for help from any earthly means. She had never prayed for anything
      before. She had always taken what she wanted and gone her way; but she had
      had few needs. Now in this strange anguish she could do nothing for
      herself, and surely it was the place of the Virgin and the saints to help
      her. She stormed the painted wax figure in its niche with appeals which
      were innocently like demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make him come back&mdash;make him come back to her. Mother of God, he must
      return! Make him come to the wall some night&mdash;yes, to-night. He must
      not know that she was like Sarita, but he must come; and whatsoever she
      did or said he must not go away again. She would sell her new necklace;
      the silver comb her mother had left, her&mdash;the comb her father had
      given her mother in the days of their courtship; she would do some work,
      and give to the Holy Mother some candles and flowers; but he must come
      back, and he must not go away again whatsoever she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt upon the stone floor, her hands wrung together, pouring forth
      the same words breathlessly over and over, each reiteration more intense
      than the last, all her young strength going out into the appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still she had not yet reached the point of knowing what she should do
      and say when he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she tried to rise to her feet she was obliged to make two efforts
      before she succeeded. She had given such a passion of strength to her
      siege that she was almost exhausted, and she went out into the dazzling
      sunlight trembling. She did this day after day, day after day, and at
      night she waited by the wall, but the road was always the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she could hear nothing&mdash;not a word. She could not ask, even
      though sometimes as she sat and gazed at José with hungry eyes it seemed
      as if she must drop dead if he did not speak. But he did not speak because
      he could have told her but little, and was quite secure in his belief that
      the mere mention of Sebastiano's name angered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the time went by&mdash;weeks and months&mdash;and at last one evening
      she went to the church and prayed a new prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sacred Mother," she said, "I have sold the comb and the necklace, and I
      have worked and can keep my word. I have bought a little golden heart. And
      if he comes"&mdash;in a fainter whisper&mdash;"if he comes I will say
      nothing ill to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, for the first time, she heard of Sebastiano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Carlos came in and was full of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say that Sebastiano has had great success, and that perhaps he will
      go to America."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is America?" asked Jovita.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is at the other end of the world, and never yet have the people seen a
      bull-fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never?" said José, staring. "That is impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," answered Carlos. "And they are rich, and like new things;
      and the king has spoken of sending for Sebastiano. He will be rich enough
      to build a palace for his old age."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, in the dusk of the evening, there crept into the church
      a little figure familiar to the painted saints and the waxen Virgin. But
      to-day it wore a changed aspect. It moved slowly at first, reluctantly;
      the brilliant little face was pale; the eyes wild with torture. A moment
      it stood before the altar, and then flung up its arms with a fierce
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother of God," it cried, brokenly, "then if it must be so&mdash;tell him&mdash;tell
      him that I am like Sarita!" and fell upon the altar steps shuddering and
      sobbing like a beaten child.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And yet it was again weeks and weeks before she heard another word. In
      those weeks there were times when she hated José because he never once
      spoke of what she wished to hear. She could not speak herself&mdash;she
      could not ask questions; she could only wait&mdash;hungry and desolate.
      They would not even say&mdash;these people&mdash;whether he had gone to
      the King of America or not; whether he was at the other end of the world,
      or whether he was only in some other city. The truth was that José had
      innocently cautioned the others against speaking of one whom Pepita
      disliked to hear of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does not like him," he said, sorrowfully. "Girls are like that
      sometimes. It makes her angry when one talks of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      But slow as he was, he could not help seeing in time that something was
      wrong with Pepita. Sometimes she scarcely talked at all, and she did not
      flame up when Jovita grumbled; it seemed as if she scarcely heard. Her
      eyes had grown bigger, too, and there was a burning light in them. They
      always appeared to be asking something; often he found himself obliged to
      look up, and saw them fixed upon him, as if they meant to wrest something
      from him. The careless bird-like look had gone, the careless bird-like
      laughter and mocking. He began gradually to fancy she was always thinking
      of something that hurt and excited her. But then there was nothing. She
      had all she wanted. She had as many trinkets as the other girls; she had
      even more. She had so little work to do that she had sought some outside
      her home to fill her spare moments, and she loved no one. There was not a
      man she knew who would not have come if she had smiled. What, then, could
      it be? And how pretty she was! Prettier than ever; prettier because of the
      burning look in her eyes, and&mdash;and something else he could not
      explain; a kind of restless grace of movement, as if she was always on the
      alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not pleased with Madrid any longer?" he asked her once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me," he said, slowly, and with much caution, "that you do not
      amuse yourself as you did at first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not so new," she said; "but there is still pleasure enough." And
      for a moment she kept her great eager eyes fixed upon him, and then she
      moved slowly toward him and touched him with a soft touch on his big
      clumsy shoulder and said: "You are a good brother! You are a good
      brother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have always loved you," he said, with simple pride. "When we were
      children, you know I always promised that you should see better days."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had forgotten to count the weeks and days, or to take note of the
      changing seasons, when one hot day in the early summer he came in&mdash;José&mdash;with
      an innocent joy in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked questioningly at Pepita two or three times and then coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not mind now," he said. "It is so long ago, and it is all over.
      Sebastiano has come back. He did not go to America; he is in Madrid
      to-day. He came to me in the street; he did not avoid me; he was rejoiced
      to see me. It appears that it is all well with him. Afterward Manuel told
      me. It appears there is a very pretty girl he met in Lisbon&mdash;she is
      here now. It is said he will marry her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepita clinched her hands and stared at him with eyes that burned as never
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not true!" she said through her teeth. "It is not true!"
    </p>
    <p>
      José fell back two steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not true?" he stammered. "Why not? They say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man who slays bulls as he does," she said, "does not forget a woman in
      a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      José was lost in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you believed nothing but ill of him," he said. "What has
      happened? You are angry&mdash;angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not true about the girl from Lisbon," she said. "It is a lie they
      amuse themselves with."
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had innocent José been so thunderstruck. This was beyond his
      understanding. He was afraid to speak, and kept looking sidewise at her as
      he ate his soup; but she said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened?" he said to himself over and over again. "Will she not
      allow him to marry another, though she does not want him herself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Later he went out again. It must be confessed that he went in the hope of
      seeing Sebastiano, or at least hearing of him. There was no difficulty in
      hearing of him. In the wine-shops and at the street corners he was being
      talked of in every group. Of what else could people speak who knew he had
      returned? How there would be sport&mdash;how there would be pleasure! Life
      began to wear a more vivacious aspect. And what had he not done since he
      had left Madrid? Such success&mdash;such adulation! The impression among
      his adorers was that the whole world had been at his feet. Here and there
      one could hear snatches of song of which his name was the refrain. It was
      only because he so loved his own people that he had refused the
      magnificent offers made by the King of America. He had refused them; he
      had chosen to remain in Spain. He had come to Madrid. Soon he would appear
      before them again. He had even gained in strength and dexterity; and as to
      his good looks&mdash;ah! what a dashing, handsome fellow!
    </p>
    <p>
      José had the good luck to see him again, even to speak to him. What
      fortune&mdash;what happiness! The honest fellow felt himself overjoyed.
      They were to be friends again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite late when he found himself walking homeward over the white
      road again. He had drunk wine enough to make him feel quite gay; and as he
      went he sang now and then a verse of a song about the joys of the
      bull-fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was about half-way home he thought he heard behind him the sound
      of rapid feet&mdash;light feet running. He stopped and looked back. What
      was it he saw, or thought he saw? Was it a small dark shape which flitted
      instantly into the shadow of the trees? It looked like a woman who did not
      wish to be seen. Well, he would not look, then. What was the use of giving
      her trouble? He tramped on, perhaps a little more slowly. It was late for
      a woman to be out on the lonely road alone. It must be past midnight. Then
      the thought came to him that perhaps she wished to pass him. In that case
      he might look the other way, on the opposite side of the road. In fact, he
      crossed to the other side to leave the way clear, and went on
      good-naturedly, singing his song loudly and all out of tune. Yes, he had
      been right. Soon the footsteps drew nearer; the shadow within the shadow
      slipped past&mdash;ran swiftly. But by that time they were nearing his
      home, and there was a stretch of road unshaded by anything. The shadow
      hesitated, darted across the white space, and José, seeing it in the full
      light, uttered a cry, and started in pursuit. In but a few moments he had
      reached it and held it by the arm, feeling all the slender body breathless
      and panting.

    <p>
      "Pepita!" he cried. "It is you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She let the mantilla drop from her face and stood and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she answered, "it is Pepita; and you need not ask&mdash;I will not
      tell you. I have been to&mdash;to look at something&mdash;and I will tell
      you nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand up and rubbed his forehead violently. Then he let it drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not ask," he said. "You would do no wrong. You are a good girl;
      but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think I have gone mad," she said, with a sudden change of voice and a
      piteous little shiver. "Who knows? Perhaps some one has cast the evil-eye
      upon me. But I have done no harm, and I shall do none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said, rather stupidly. "You would do no harm. Let us go in,
      then."
    </p>
    <p>
      And without another word they went into the house, Pepita to her bed to be
      awake and gaze at the darkness, José to sit with his head in his hands and
      thinking a thousand wild thoughts until he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not know that where he had been she had been also; that when the
      snatches of song had been sung she had heard them; that when the people
      had talked of Sebastiano she had listened; that when Sebastiano had stood
      in the bright light she had stood in the shadow and watched. She had not
      thought of danger or of being discovered. She had only thought of one
      thing and listened for one thing&mdash;and once she had heard this thing
      discussed by some chattering young chulos.

    <p>
      "She is a pretty young girl," they said. "Not as pretty as that other, but
      handsome enough. She was a little devil, that other. But it is a mistake
      for a man like him to marry. How can a man feel free to risk his life
      gayly when he has a woman hung about his neck?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will not," she whispered, growing hot all over. "No, he has not
      forgotten. I have given the little heart and the flowers and candles. And
      he could not forget while I&mdash;He will come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      She struggled with the passionate persistence of a child. Since she would
      not give him up, he was hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not know what to do. There was nothing but to wait in this
      fever of strange misery and unrest, which grew more cruel every day; and
      at the bull-fight if he would only look&mdash;perhaps&mdash;yes, if he saw
      her face, he would understand and come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days before the great entertainment took place she was like some
      little savage creature at bay. She could scarcely bear to hear the voices
      of those who spoke to her. Once she went into the church and threw herself
      upon her knees as usual, but when she looked up her eyes were fierce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he does not come," she cried to the waxen Virgin, "I will pray to you
      no more&mdash;no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that it was blasphemy, but she did not care; and before she went
      home she bought a sharp little knife and hid it in her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," she whispered, "this&mdash;if it is true about the girl from
      Lisbon; but it is not true."
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years afterward the day of the great bull-fight was remembered.
      No one who saw it forgot it as long as he lived. Affairs used to date from
      it in the minds of many.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year had passed since that first brilliant day when Pepita had gone
      forth in her first festal dress. She remembered it all as she dressed
      herself on this other morning. The same day seemed to have come again; the
      same sunshine and deep blue sky. There were the same flowers nodding their
      heads; Jovita was grumbling a little in her haste, just as she had done
      then; and in the looking-glass there was the same little figure in the
      bright attire&mdash;the soft black hair, the red rose, the red mouth. As
      she looked, a sudden triumph made her radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not grown ugly," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she had not grown ugly. She was too young and strong for that, and
      excitement had flushed her into new brilliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she found herself seated among the fluttering fans of rainbow colors,
      that moment's glow of exultation left her. Strangely enough, she could not
      help thinking of the empty church and the waxen figure before which she
      had knelt, and then of the nights when she had stood watching by the wall,
      and then of the sharp little knife in her breast. And then came the clamor
      of the music and the grand entry of the moving stream of color and glitter
      dazzling her eyes. No; just at first she had not the power to look. Could
      it be she&mdash;Pepita&mdash;who felt dizzy and could not see? who could
      distinguish nothing in the splendid panorama of the triumphal march? And
      what clamor, what excitement there was on every side! "What bulls! What
      men!" they were saying about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only she seemed, in the midst of all the loud-voiced eagerness and
      delight, to sit alone, a cold little figure vaguely tormented by the
      gayety and the voices and the color of fluttering fans and ribbons and
      costumes. The deep rose had fled from her face; she sat with her hands
      wrung on her knee and waited for one moment to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great bull ran bellowing around the arena; little beribboned darts
      were flung at him and stuck in his shaggy shoulders; brilliant cloaks were
      flaunted in his face; taunting cries mocked him. He charged hither and
      thither in blind fury, scattering men and horses, who only returned again
      to the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It takes too long," communed Pepita, "It takes too long."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the voices began to call for Sebas-tiano. "Sebastiano!
      Sebastiano!" on every side&mdash;even the grand ladies and their cavaliers
      clapping their hands and calling also. The beauties in the high places
      were always ready to see him come, and to give him a welcome when he
      risked his life to amuse them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped forth in his rich dress and with his gallant bearing, a more
      beautiful and gay figure than ever, it seemed the excited people thought.
      He had grown finer, without doubt, they said. His face was a little pale,
      but that only made more beautiful his long dark eyes, under their dense,
      straight, black lashes. It was the women who said this, and who saw the
      richness of his dress, the colors of his <i>devisa</i>, the close curl of
      his crisp hair, the grace of his movement. The men saw his superb limbs,
      his firm step, his quick glance, his bright sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, little slayer of bulls," they shouted, "and show us what you would
      have taught the people of America."
    </p>
    <p>
      And it appeared they were not to be disappointed in their expectation of
      sport. They saw that when he stood before the bull and made a little
      mocking bow of salute, he looked into its small, furious eyes with a
      smile, as it drew near&mdash;a bellowing black mass, snorting and throwing
      up the dust. It was as ready to begin as he. It rushed upon him, and he
      was gone. He played with it, led it on, defied it, eluded it. The flashing
      sword seemed to become a score of glittering blades; the people shouted&mdash;rose
      in their seats&mdash;leaned forward&mdash;laughed&mdash;mocked the bull&mdash;cried
      out praises of sword and man and beast&mdash;of each leap&mdash;each touch
      of the steel's point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He plays with it as if it were a little lamb," they cried. "Sebastiano!
      Sebastiano!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Of what use to tell what must be seen in all its danger to be understood?
      The joy and exultation rose to fierce fever-heat, the cries swelled
      higher, faces flushed and eyes sparkled and flamed, while the brilliant
      figure darted, leaped, attacked, played with death as it had done scores
      of times before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Pepita sat without color or applause&mdash;only Pepita's fan was
      motionless amidst all the fluttering&mdash;though her breast moved up and
      down, and the throbbing in her side was like the beating of a hammer. She
      was speaking to herself, though her lips were closed; she was speaking to
      Sebastiano.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will look soon," she was saying. "He will look as he did that first
      day. My eyes will make him look. They will force him to it. Listen! it is
      Pepita whose eyes are on you. You must feel them. You have not forgotten.
      No. And it is Pepita&mdash;Pepita!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the strength of her body and soul she threw into her gaze&mdash;all
      the fire of her young wildly beating heart and throbbing pulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must hear," she said. "Pepita! Pepita!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And unconsciously she leaned forward so that her white face and great
      eyes, and the little black head with the rose burning in its hair, stood
      out among the faces of those about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he looked up and saw her, and their eyes met; and without knowing she
      started to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one knew, no one but herself saw, how it happened: even she did not
      understand until all was past. Their eyes met, as they had done on the day
      a year before. No, not as they had done then, but with a strange new look.
      Sebastiano started; the arena swam before him; there was a second&mdash;a
      fatal second in which he saw only a small face without color and the red
      rose which was the color of blood. Then there was a roar near him&mdash;a
      roar among the people&mdash;a wild shriek from the women. The bull was
      upon him; he made a misstep, and was caught, amid the shrieks and bellows,
      and flung inert far out upon the hoof-trodden dust with the blood pouring
      from his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," they said in the wine-shops at night, "when they took him up,
      though they thought him gasping in death, he had not lost himself; and as
      they carried him out they came upon a girl&mdash;the one who is called
      'the pretty sister of José'&mdash;her brother was taking her away. She
      looked like one dead three days; and Sebastiano&mdash;there is a man for
      you!&mdash;tore the <i>devisa</i> from his shoulder and dropped it at her
      feet; and she snatched it up&mdash;all wet with his blood&mdash;and thrust
      it in her breast, and dropped like a stone. It is said that he loved her,
      and she had a devil of a temper and treated him badly. He is a good fellow&mdash;her
      brother José&mdash;and wept like a child for Sebastiano, and has begged to
      be allowed to nurse him, and Sebastiano will have it so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am strong as an ox," José had said, weeping. "I can watch like a dog. I
      want neither sleep nor food, if it comes to that; and once when one of my
      comrades fell from a scaffold I was the only one who could nurse him
      without killing him with the pain. He will tell you that I nursed him
      well, and was never tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him stay," said Sebastiano.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his struggle with death, which lasted so long, it was always the large
      form and simple, anxious face of José he saw when he knew what passed
      around him, and even when the fever brought him delirious visions he was
      often vaguely conscious of his presence. For himself, he did not know
      whether he was to live or die; but one night he found out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful night which came after a long day in which those about
      his bed had looked at him with pitying eyes, and at last a priest had come
      and absolved him of his sins, and left him with a solemn, kindly blessing,
      with a soul clear of stain and ready for paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fallen asleep afterward, and had dreamed not of heaven but of
      earth, of a red rose in soft black hair, and of a passionate little face
      whose large eyes glowed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he was wide awake, and found his dream a living truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      José was no longer in the room. The moonlight made everything clear, and
      upon the floor beside him knelt Pepita, her eyes fixed upon his.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      "Dios! Dios!" he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" she said. "Do not speak. It is Pepita. Look at me. They said that
      perhaps to-night you would die. I have prayed until I can pray no more,
      and when I came to José the tears were falling from his eyes, and he said
      perhaps you would not see the day. Then I showed him the little knife
      hidden in my breast, and told him if he did not let me come to you alone I
      would not live. I said I could force you to remain on earth. I love you&mdash;I
      love you. It has all happened, that which you said would happen; and when
      the <i>devisa</i> fell at my feet I hid it in my breast with the other
      which was there before. And because I love you so, you cannot die. I will
      do anything you say I must do. I am Pepita, and I give myself to you. I
      would give my blood and my life and my soul for you. Every night I have
      waited by the wall in the hope that you would come. I have watched you
      when you did not see me. If you had not come I should have killed myself;
      if you die, I will drive the knife to its hilt in my heart. I can love
      more than those women who love so easily and so often. I knew nothing
      about it when I was so proud and mocked you. I know now. Mother of God! it
      is like a thousand deaths when one cannot see the face one wants. What
      hunger night and day!&mdash;one is driven mad by it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent more closely over him, crushing his un wounded hand against her
      heart&mdash;searching his soul with her look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They said there was a girl in Lisbon whom you loved," she said. "I knew
      it was a lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he whispered, "it was a lie. Kiss me on the mouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      His arm curved itself around her neck, and the red lips which had mocked
      melted upon his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you suffer?" he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to sob like a child, as she had sobbed at the feet of the
      Virgin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you that you would suffer! It was the same thing with me. Saints
      of Heaven! human beings cannot bear that long. I shall not die, and I will
      make you forget the pain. Stay with me, and let me see your eyes and touch
      your lips every hour, that I may know you are Pepita, and that you have
      given yourself to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will stay through all the day and night," she answered. "They cannot
      make me go away if I do not wish it. They always give me my way. I have
      always had it&mdash;the Virgin herself has given it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed this was true. In a few months from then the people who strolled
      in the Public Garden on Sunday looked at a beautiful young couple who
      walked together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are two who are mad with love for each other," it was said.
      "Sebastiano and his wife. She is the one he threw his <i>devisa</i> to
      when he thought himself a dead man. They used to call her 'the pretty
      sister of Jose.'"

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
